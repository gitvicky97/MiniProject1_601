# Coding Tips


Want to know how to program faster so that you can deliver software faster? Sure, who doesn't? The internet is full of tips  for developers—hundreds, thousands, perhaps even millions of them. The problem is, there are far more out there than anyone has time to read, so I've boiled them down for you.


## The problem with "faster"

To code faster, one has to be efficient; that is, no wasted effort or motion. This can mean everything from typing to tools to thinking. But most of our work as programmers isn’t typing, or compiling—it’s thinking. To think faster, you have to learn more patterns and relationships. This is the knowledge and wisdom that experience builds. What you need to go faster will change over time.

## The problem with "tips"

Most of the tips I read only apply at certain points along my journey, and don't necessarily apply to everyone. Many of these fall into the “personal journey” or  “what worked for me” categories. But my path is probably not your path. While some of the mechanical things that work for me will probably work for you, many of the domain and pattern choices I made may be of no use.

The mechanical stuff is pretty easy to optimize; the options are limited. But the learning stuff has no limits. No one will ever know it all. You must make strategic and tactical choices, and be prepared to take advantage of opportunities when they arise.

The utility of tips falls off as a function of specificity. The more specific tips don’t apply to everyone, but general tips are too, well, general. They’re much more difficult to turn into action. So what do you really want when you say you want to "go faster?" I'll tell you.

## What you want is flow

What every programmer wants, especially in the era of DevOps, is flow. Flow state maximizes throughput and increases enjoyment by incorporating just the right level of challenge; one stays fully engaged in the moment and in the work (this is not to be confused with the Ballmer Peak). Sustaining flow state requires a suitable environment and frictionless process.

Flow state when pairing is like each of you having an extra brain. Unfortunately, many developer environments, such as open offices, are unfriendly to flow.

## Your options may be limited

When you find something sub-optimal about your process, or yourself, the choices of how to address such constraints are limited:

* **Ignore it.**  Maybe it will get better on its own.

* **Avoid it.** Is it really necessary?

* **Automate it.** Make the machine do it.

* **Delegate it.** Rarely possible, this is passing the buck. But it is a legit option when available.

* **Grind it down.** We all have to do this from time to time (daily). Some  jobs are larger than others.

If your typing is slower than you’d like, take a little time and level up. If your integrated development environment is confusing and unhelpful (or perhaps too helpful), try something different or simpler. If you can’t get away from it, learn more about it; you may find another way, or at least learn the limits.

There are numerous ways to learn. Google is your friend, as are books, videos, blog posts, Stack Overflow questions, and, of course, other people. Some things you want to learn may be hidden; others may be larger than they appear. Balance benefit with effort and be patient with yourself. Celebrate every achievement and keep moving.

## Top tips for programming faster

One way of grouping and looking at the tips below is by applying a few high-level categories as a way to draw interesting generalizations from the collection:

* **Reflect.** What do you want, what do you actually do; includes measuring and optimization.

* **Flow.** No friction from tools, processes, environment, or knowledge; seek continual challenge but not too much.

* **Learn.** The fundamentals: languages, tools, patterns, practices, etc., from everyone (especially those willing to teach); learn how you learn, and learn continuously.

* **Teach.** Teach others. Having to explain things forces simplification, and the transformation from thoughts to verbal or visual expressions produces insights.

* **Express and explore.** Look outside your normal duties; draw, write, blog, go to meetups, attend and give presentations.
