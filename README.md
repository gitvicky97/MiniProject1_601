# MiniProject1_601
This project helps one to understand how to use **Terminal, Git, Docker** and how to automate an project by using all these tools!

* **Objective:**

In this project, students are required to work in groups in 2 or 3. A single repository should be developed between each group. One person was elected to merge pull requests as the team leader. It is required to have at least 10 substantive commits per group member that are marked "feature". Any fixes to "features" must be marked as fixes and do not count. Commits for creating files or renaming files or other non-feature work should be named "task".


project must include an explanation of how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company. It must also include a section that explains and gives example usage of Vi in order to create and edit files on Linux and the basic commands that you need to manage the file system. An explanation of the The gitFlow workflow must also be included and a section defining Git commands and terminology and examples of their use.


## **To Do List**

- [X] @mentions, #refs, [links](),**formatting** are supported.
- [X] Make a new Markdown Files : **Different files created to explain idvidually**
- [x] Attach dependencies: **snapshots of working commands attached**


# So let's get started and master all these tools!

* [Terminal Tutorial](/Terminal_tutorial.md)
 
     A Terminal is an interface to the underlying operating system via a shell, usually bash. It is a command line. Back in the day, a Terminal was a screen+keyboard that was connected to a server.


* [vi editor](/vi_editor.md)
  
     The default editor that comes with the UNIX operating system is called vi (visual editor). Using vi editor, we can edit an existing file or create a new file from scratch. we can also use this editor to just read a text file.
 
* [Git Tutorial](/Git_tutorial.md)
 
     The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository. A git repository contains, among other things, the following: A set of commit objects.

* [Docker Tutorial](/Docker_tutorial.md)
  
     Docker is basically a container engine which uses the Linux Kernel features like namespaces and control groups to create containers on top of an operating system and automates application deployment on the container. Docker uses Copy-on-write union file system for its backend storage.
