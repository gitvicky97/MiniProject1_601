# Terminal Tutorial
* **What is Terminal?**

Terminal is a utility that allows you to interact with your Mac through the command line. Linux operating systems include similar tools, since both Linux and macOS are Unix-like OSes. The command line interface (CLI), or the language that you type into Terminal to interact with your Mac, is called **bash**. Everything we discuss below is a bash command.

* **Why Use the Terminal?**

Wasn't the whole point of graphical user interfaces to eliminate the need for a command line? Well, not really. There are still several reasons that you should learn how to use the Terminal if you are a developer, or even a user who cares about performance:

* Certain things simply cannot be done without the command line (especially as a developer). These include installing CocoaPods, using a git repository, and more

* You can easily make changes to your computer's settings which would be tedious or even impossible to do using the user interface only.

* The terminal is very flexible, and once you learn to use it, it is quite simple and straightforward.

* It is a very direct way of telling your computer what to do, whereas a GUI is akin to controlling the computer from a distance.

Those are just a few of the reasons that the Terminal is still a useful tool today. It's a practical and functional tool to improve and enhance your daily interactions with your computer.

# Getting Started

* Open **Terminal** 
Terminal is located in your **Applications** folder within a subfolder called **Utilities**. If you cannot find it, activate Spotlight search by pressing **Command-Spacebar** and search for **Terminal**. Once you have it open, you should see something which looks like this:
